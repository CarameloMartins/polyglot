## Contributing

For now, contributions will only be accepted for the `languages.yml` file because the project is still under heavy development and, specially, lacking a definitive direction.

We want to understand where we want to go first, and go there, before we can have other people on board.

Still, if you want to contribute with ideas or found any kind of bug, just create a new issue and we'd be glad to hear from you.

## Testing

We are still having some difficulties integrating the testing suite with the rest of the application. We're working hard on it.
